# Outline {.unnumbered}

## Course Overview

This mini-course introduces shader programming as a tool for mathematical illustration and exploration. Shaders are programs that run in parallel on the GPU, making them exceptionally fast for visualization tasks. We'll learn to write code that "reads like mathematics" using Shadertoy, a beginner-friendly web-based platform that handles all the low-level programming complexities.

**Format:** Five days, each with one hour of lecture and approximately 1.5 hours of homework

**Prerequisites:** Strong foundation in undergraduate mathematics; no prior experience with shaders or GLSL required

**Audience:** Graduate students, postdocs, and faculty in mathematics

## Assessment Philosophy

This is a workshop-style course focused on skill development. Success means:
- Completing required homework to keep pace
- Experimenting with optional problems based on interest
- Developing intuition for when shader programming is appropriate
- Leaving with working code templates for future projects

**Philosophy:** Getting something working and understanding it is more valuable than perfect, polished results. The goal is to build practical skills and mathematical intuition, not to create production-quality graphics.
